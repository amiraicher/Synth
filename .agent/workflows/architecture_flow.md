1. Read the project outline skill to understand the current architecture.
   // turbo
   Run `type c:\projects\Synth\.gemini\project_outline\SKILL.md`
2. Execute the user's requested task.
3. Update `c:\projects\Synth\SKILL.md` to reflect any architectural changes, new components, or design decisions made during the task.
4. Suggest copying the updated `SKILL.md` to the project outline.
   // turbo
   Run `copy /Y c:\projects\Synth\SKILL.md c:\projects\Synth\.gemini\project_outline\SKILL.md`
